<h3> <strong> What is an Open Node?</strong></h3>
<h2>Use these at your own risk!</h2>
<p>The AEON software architecture allows for an easy way to use AEON without downloading the entire blockchain.
This is called "using a remote node"; these are often referred to as "public nodes" becasue they are open for anyone to connect. Essentially, your wallet program connects to someone elses aeond (blockchain) program, a.k.a "node" a.k.a. network service</p>
<p>It is somewhat slower, and there is some information leak, <a href="http://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/38/what-privacy-or-security-trade-offs-are-associated-with-not-running-your-own-ful">as explained here for Monero</a>, AEON is similar.</p>
<p>That being said, no one can steal your AEON because you use a remote node. </p> 
<h1>You should really run your own node, or three, or twelve.</h1>
<p>These remote nodes are not necessarily reliable, your mileage may vary, I do not play a lawyer on TV.</p>

<p>Aeon-Wallet maintains two different collections of open nodes. One is a collection of random nodes - anyone can offer their node up for inclusion, and Aeon-Wallet will detect it and include it. These are the Random Nodes seen below.</p>
<p>The second type of open node are those listed as web addresses, like node.aeon-wallet.net. There are limited nodes in these addresses, and their status isn't checked (yet). So they may be down.</p>
<h3>Please consider donating if you use these open nodes.</h3>
<p>I run some of them, others run others.</p>

<h1>Random Nodes!</h1>
<p>Aeon-Wallet runs a <a href="https://github.com/LesPristy/moneriote">script</a> every 30 minutes to  scan the Monero network for open nodes. Click the button to get an IP address of a random one!</p>
<input type="button" id="btnSearch" value="Get Random Node!" onclick="GetValue();" />
<p>These nodes use the standard port: 11181.</p>
<p id="message" >Press The Button!</p>
<p>There are <span id="numnodes">this many random nodes</span> available</p>
<br>
<p> To use with aeon-wallet-cli, just use these commands </p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p><kbd>aeon-wallet-cli.exe --daemon-address <span id="windows-node-ip">ADDRESS.OF.HOST</span>:11181</kbd></p>
<h3>Unix-type (ubuntu, MacOS)</h3>
<p><kbd>./aeon-wallet-cli --daemon-address <span id="unix-node-ip">ADDRESS.OF.HOST</span>:11181</kbd></p>
<br>
<h3>Aeon GUI (official)</h3>
<p>To use with the Aeon GUI, enter the node address here (or the ip address). Be sure to enter the proper port!

<h3>Non-random Aeon-Wallet Open Node Addresses</h3>
<p>How does it work? the open node addresses actually point to many different nodes - when you request one, one in the list is selected. So if it doesn't work once, just try again. Technically, this is considered DNS round-robin. It's actually pretty random too...</p>
<br>
<p><kbd>--daemon-host node.xmrbackb.one</kbd></p>


<br>

<p>If you would like to offer your node up for inclusion in the Aeon-Wallet Network of Open Nodes: you can simply add the following code to the launch of your daemon (and open your firewall), and the MoneroWorld script will sniff you out and add your node to the random list</p>
<p><kbd>--rpc-bind-ip YOUR.EXTERNAL_IP.GOES.HERE --rpc-bind-port 11181 --restricted-rpc --confirm-external-bind</kbd></p>
<br>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LesPristy/moneriote">Run the script on your own daemon!</a> 
<h3>Hidden Nodes</h3>
<p>We currently don't have any hidden nodes.</p>
